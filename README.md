# Spam-Bot
PyAutoGUI-based automation bot that repeatedly types and sends custom reminders (e.g., “Drink water!”, “Take medicine!”) at fixed time intervals.

A Python automation project that uses PyAutoGUI to send repeated reminders (like Drink water!, Take medicine!, Walk the dog!) automatically in any active application (chat apps, text editors, or terminals).

This bot simulates typing and pressing Enter, making it useful for building custom auto-reminder systems or even lightweight spamming tools (⚠️ use responsibly).
